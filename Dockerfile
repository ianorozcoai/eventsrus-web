# Multi-stage build so the final image only carries the JRE + the fat jar,
# not the JDK/Maven toolchain used to build it. Railway auto-detects this
# file at the repo root and builds from it instead of Nixpacks - every push
# to the connected branch triggers a fresh build + deploy of this image.

# Railway assigns $PORT at deploy time (it varies) and routes traffic to it -
# Spring Boot itself only understands --server.port/SERVER_PORT, so the
# substitution has to happen at container start, in shell form, not as a
# fixed ENV baked into the image. MaxRAMPercentage keeps the JVM heap sized
# sanely off the container's actual memory limit instead of the JVM's
# default (25%, too conservative for a small single-app container).
